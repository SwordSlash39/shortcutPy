# diffPy
My own module!

In this module, you try to do as complex things as possible with only 11 different codes in this module! If you need it, you may use
other different code but try not to! For every non-shortcutPy statement used, give yourself 1 strike. At the end, count the amount of strikes
you have. Advisable to have at most 1 strike. Good luck!
